  searching through man pages or bookmarks. It provides instant access to
  your command knowledge base with natural language fuzzy search.

  Key principles:
  - Speed: Find any command in milliseconds
  - Beautiful: Elegant terminal output with syntax highlighting
  - Portable: Single binary with embedded cheatsheets
  - Extensible: Easy to add your own commands
  - Smart: Fuzzy matching understands what you mean
